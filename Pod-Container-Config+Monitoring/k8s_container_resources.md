# Managing Container Resources in Kubernetes

## Overview

Kubernetes provides powerful mechanisms to manage container resources through **Resource Requests** and **Resource Limits**. These features help ensure efficient resource allocation, prevent resource starvation, and maintain cluster stability.

## Container Resources

Container resource management in Kubernetes consists of two main components:

- **Resource Requests**: Define the minimum resources a container needs
- **Resource Limits**: Define the maximum resources a container can use

## Resource Requests

### What are Resource Requests?

Resource requests allow users to define the minimum amount of resources that a container expects to use. This information is crucial for the Kubernetes scheduler to make informed decisions about pod placement.

### Key Features:

- **Scheduling Guidance**: The Kube Scheduler uses resource requests to avoid scheduling pods on nodes that don't have sufficient available resources
- **Flexible Usage**: Containers are allowed to use more or less than the requested resources
- **Primary Purpose**: Resource requests are primarily used for scheduling decisions, not runtime enforcement

### Resource Units:

#### Memory
- Measured in **Bytes**
- Can be defined using suffixes:
  - `Mi` (Mebibytes) = 1024Â² bytes
  - `Gi` (Gibibytes) = 1024Â³ bytes
  - `Ki` (Kibibytes) = 1024 bytes

#### CPU
- Measured in **CPU units**
- `1 vCPU = 1000m (millicores)`
- Can be expressed as:
  - Decimal: `0.25` (quarter of a CPU)
  - Millicores: `250m` (250 millicores)

### Example YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
```

## Resource Limits

### What are Resource Limits?

Resource limits define the maximum amount of resources that a container can consume. These limits are enforced at runtime by the container runtime.

### Key Features:

- **Runtime Enforcement**: Limits are imposed when the container is actually running
- **Hard Boundaries**: Containers cannot exceed the specified limits
- **Protection**: Prevents containers from consuming excessive resources and affecting other workloads

### Enforcement Behavior:

#### Memory Limits
- If a container exceeds its memory limit, it will be killed (OOMKilled)
- The pod may be restarted depending on the restart policy

#### CPU Limits
- CPU usage is throttled when the limit is reached
- The container continues to run but with restricted CPU access

### Example YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

## Complete Resource Configuration

### Best Practice Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-server
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:latest
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Set Requests
- Define resource requests for all containers
- Use realistic estimates based on application profiling
- Consider startup resource requirements

### 2. Set Appropriate Limits
- Set limits higher than requests to allow for burst usage
- Avoid setting limits too low, which can cause throttling
- Monitor actual usage to tune limits

### 3. Resource Ratios
- **Memory**: Limit should be 1.5-2x the request
- **CPU**: Limit can be 2-4x the request for bursty workloads

### 4. Quality of Service (QoS) Classes

Kubernetes assigns QoS classes based on resource configuration:

#### Guaranteed
- Requests = Limits for all containers
- Highest priority, least likely to be evicted

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
  limits:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

#### Burstable
- Requests < Limits or only requests specified
- Medium priority

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "64Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

#### BestEffort
- No requests or limits specified
- Lowest priority, first to be evicted

## Resource Monitoring

### Useful Commands:

```bash
# View resource usage of pods
kubectl top pods

# View resource usage of nodes
kubectl top nodes

# Describe pod to see resource configuration
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Get resource quotas
kubectl get resourcequota
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Pod Pending State**
   - Usually indicates insufficient node resources
   - Check node capacity and resource requests

2. **OOMKilled Containers**
   - Container exceeded memory limits
   - Increase memory limits or optimize application

3. **CPU Throttling**
   - Container hitting CPU limits frequently
   - Monitor with `kubectl top` and adjust limits

4. **Resource Conflicts**
   - Multiple containers competing for resources
   - Review and adjust resource allocations

## Advanced Topics

### Limit Ranges
Set default and maximum resource constraints at namespace level:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: default-limits
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      memory: "128Mi"
      cpu: "500m"
    defaultRequest:
      memory: "64Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    type: Container
```

### Resource Quotas
Control total resource consumption per namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: compute-quota
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "4"
    requests.memory: 8Gi
    limits.cpu: "8"
    limits.memory: 16Gi
```

## Conclusion

Proper resource management is crucial for maintaining a stable and efficient Kubernetes cluster. By understanding and correctly implementing resource requests and limits, you can:

- Ensure predictable application performance
- Prevent resource contention
- Optimize cluster utilization
- Maintain system stability

Remember: **Resource requests** are for scheduling, **resource limits** are for runtime enforcement. Both are essential for production workloads.
